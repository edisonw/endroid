#Endroid
A robot that I am trying to build with Android, Arduino, and Vex Robotics. 

###Current state:

Basic motor controll code is in the repository right now. You can find the arduino sketches and an sample app that manages the arduino connections as a service. Currently I am in the progress of adding remote control protocols and writing a server that will be included in here as well.
