Basic motor controll code is in the repository right now. You can find the arduino sketches and an sample app that manages the arduino connections as a service. Currently I am in the progress of adding remote control protocols and writing a server that will be included in here as well.

Added a lgiht sensor that will output high/low to a PWM pin.
